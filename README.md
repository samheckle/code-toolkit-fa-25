### Overview
This course provides an introduction to the foundational building blocks of software development, such as variables, control structures, data structures, and modular code organization. Coding work will be conducted using the Javascript programming language, and while examples and syntax will be specific to this platform, the course is structured around core concepts applicable to most programming languages in use today. Coursework will consist of hands-on weekly programming exercises, and semi-weekly readings offering insight into the culture, politics, and history of computer programs. Midterm and final projects will afford students the opportunity to develop more substantial experiments in interactive web development, information visualization, and video game development. Access to a working laptop will be expected throughout the semester, and students can check one out from the university if necessary.

### [Statement on Technology](https://community.itp.io/community_statement#technology)

> We pledge to center creative and ethical uses of technology in our research, teaching, and making. We accept the claim that technology is a reflection of society, its histories, and its politics. We reject the claim that technology is neutral and acknowledge that every technology has the potential to do as much harm as good. We acknowledge that when technologies cause harm, the harm disproportionately affects Black, Brown, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC), queer, trans, disabled, femme, low-income, survivors, and all other marginalized bodies and communities worldwide.
>
> With this understanding, it is our responsibility to center these groups when hosting, participating in, or developing events (e.g. workshops or meetings), materials (e.g. courses, syllabi, resources), technologies (software, hardware, tools, etc) and creative applications made within this classroom (e.g. works of art, products, installations, experiments, etc).

### Expectations and Class Manifesto

1. Be curious!
    * what questions are you asking?
    * what do you not know?
    * how can you find those answers?
        * exploring the p5.js reference is a great past time
2. Practice!
    * learning to code takes time!
    * you *will* have to do a lot of work outside of class to understand what is going on in the context of your own projects  
3. Low Stress **NOT** Low Effort
    * did you learn something new? write it in your documentation!
    * did you struggle? write it in your documentation!
    * did you accomplish what you wanted? write it in your documentation!
    * if you made a solid attempt and wrote documentation (via a discussion post) you get full credit!

### Class Format

Broadly – this is similar to a math class.

You will be taught in class:

* syntax of how the coding language works
* application of how to use the coding language in a broad sense

Outside of class:

* practice the syntax
* contextualize the content in your own projects

A typical week structure might look like:

1. Review previous week’s assignment and questions
2. Introduce new content
3. Practice new content in class
    * You should be following along the demos!
4. Apply new content in upcoming assignment

### Goals
1. Have a foundational understanding of Javascript through the p5.js library
2. Insight into how digital machinery operates and mediates socio-cultural patterns of life today
3. Understand specific software elements to manipulate data, such as variables and data structures
4. Create modular and repeatable code
5. Invent interactive works of art through the use of computer programming
6. Think critically to engage with the software around us.

| Grading | |
|---|---|
|Attendance and Participation	 |15%|
|Readings |15%|
|Exercises |20%|
|Midterm |20%|
|Final |30%|

#### Resubmission Policy
You can resubmit any on-time submitted **_exercises_** (read: not the final or the midterm) based on feedback for full credit as long as you notify me in two ways:
1) Send an email with the name of the updated submission
2) Write that you updated the assignment in the assignment comments. 
You can resubmit up until the last day of class. This is to ensure you are getting feedback and learning from your mistakes – this class is based on effort and learning ability rather than technical prowess. 

#### Late Assignments
Any work is considered late if it is submitted after the due date posted on Canvas. For every day the work is late, the student will receive a 10 % penalty. You are not allowed to resubmit late work for an updated grade.

### Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) Tools: 
For the first 7 weeks of this course I would highly encourage you to to _avoid_ using AI or any external tools (other than the p5 reference) in this class. We will cover effective use cases later in the semester, but you will find you can go much further executing your ideas when you have a solid understanding of the core coding techniques.   
  
With this in mind:
* You MAY use AI in the initial stages of research, idea generation, and drafting.
* You MAY use AI for language translation.
* However, you MAY NOT not rely on AI output for significant portions of your final project form unless it is a necessary part of your project concept.
* If you use AI at any stage in the creation of your project (including initial stages, idea generation, drafting, language translation, and final form), you must properly cite and disclose this use. This should include details on the specific tool and version used, as well as the nature of your usage (for example, in programming code, images, and/or text/writing).
* Citation should reference both the platform and any creator (“style of”) names or references.
* Please follow [this citation guide](https://guides.library.harvard.edu/c.php?g=1330621&p=10046069)
* If you fail to disclose the use of AI, you will receive a 0 on the assignment.
