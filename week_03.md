## Review

### Common Problems
1. Read the instructions carefully!
2. Make sure you use appropriate naming conventions
    * Having variables named x1, x2, x3 are not helpful -> try being specific what the variable is changing
3. Code organization
    * Ensure your code is clear and easy to understand
    * Doing all the math together vs. after the shapes it impacts
4. Read your code!
    * Do you notice any patterns?
    * Is there a more efficient solution?
    * How can you write the same code in a different way?
    * Is there any redundant code? Can parts be removed?
    * Do you need the push() pop() or are you just copying the class demo?
5. When using generated code, ensure that you are translating it to what we use in class. 
    * If you are finding something we have not covered, the onus is on you to ensure that it doesnâ€™t go beyond material we have covered
    * Itâ€™s actually extra work at this point in the semester to use generated code, because it will always make the most efficient code, but we havenâ€™t gotten there yet.
    * You will receive a 0 on any assignment that uses material that goes beyond what we have covered thus far (right now you should be using variables and p5 shapes!)

### Documentation 
Feel free to reference this for future documentation

If it is easier to write about your assignment in google doc, figma, ppt that is totally fine, just make it accessible to me in some way. 

1. No high level overviews! Literally walk me through what you did: 
    * what did you try? 
    * What images/references did you pull? 
    * How did you determine color?
    * Inspirational artists? How did you land on the aesthetic?
2. Include any sketches!
    * Illustrator is helpful to get shapes correctly
    * Procreate to play with different designs
    * Any moodboards, figma, miro, google docs
    * Pen and paper
3. What were things you experimented with?
    * What experiment put you on the path for your final design? Take screenshots & screen recordings of any visual outputs.
4. Include any links
    * Citation of AI usage
    * Any other p5 sketches you might have looked at. 
    * p5.Reference is not required to be linked, unless you find it helpful.

### In-Class #2

Questions? 

### Exercise #1

### Check-In: Class Feedback

How are we feeling about this format for class notes? 
1) Is GitHub working for you as a source to hold all the class notes? 
2) Anything else helpful to include or things you might want in terms of organization?
3) Grades are out for the first 2 assignments, is there anything that you might want on top of the 3 sections (DESIGN, CODE, DOCUMENTATION)? 
4) Is there any class material that we need to cover again at this point?
5) Noticing a lot of UI/UX, website (HTML/CSS) development, and typography. anything else that might spark an interest please let me know! the end of the semester can change based on interest. 

Things you should feel comfortable with at this time:
* difference between `setup()` and `draw()`
* cartesian coordinate system 
* declaring variables using `let` and assigning variables with `=`
* using p5 variables like `width` and `height`
* using mathematical operators `+`, `-` and shorthands `+=` and `++`

Things you might need more practice with:
* `push()` and `pop()`
* `rotate()`
* `frameRate` and `sin()`


I will not forget my USB-C dongle in the future ðŸ˜Œ
