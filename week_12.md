## Project 3 Critique

## Reading Discussion

> Names are functionally territories. I become a landscape...Language shapes worlds and selves, drawing the territories that we then inhabit. Naming then, is placemaking: as naming identifies a domain of control, it becomes the act of domaining itself.

What digital territories do you inhibit? How did  your online persona (username, domain name, other identities you might be referred as) become to be? How is this different from your "birth" name? 

> The cloud is no longer just a warehouse. It is a climate model, a forecasting machine. And just as weather was institutionalized mostly for war and profit, memory is now being captured, modeled, and selectively mediated not just by the platforms we see (TikTok, Instagram), but by the cloud providers, ad networks, and analytics firms behind them. These systems sell our attention through targeted advertising, shape daily tools like search, maps, and recommendation feeds, and in some cases extend into defense or surveillance work. All of it happens largely outside our control.

How do you see yourself disengaging from these systems? How do you imagine continued use of them going forward?

> To program a television show is to schedule or to broadcast it; to program a computer is to produce a series of stored instructions that supposedly guarantee—and often stand in for—a certain action. One is descriptive, the other prescriptive.

What role does the algorithm play in prescribing labels to you? Does that match the descriptions you have about yourself?

## External Libraries

p5.js has a lot of community built libraries that we can build on top of, of which you can see the full list here: https://p5js.org/libraries/directory/

For your final project, you will pick one of these libraries to play around with. Your proposal will give you time to poke through the libraries and make some decisions as to which one you will work with. Things to consider when choosing a library:
1) What does the documentation look like?
2) Is it well-supported by the p5 community? When was the last time the library was updated?
3) Are there a lot of tutorials using the library?
4) Is it an interesting topic to you?

Some libraries I have used and like:
* [ml5.js](https://docs.ml5js.org/#/)
* [p5 touch gui](https://github.com/L05/p5.touchgui)
* [p5 play](https://github.com/quinton-ashley/p5play)
* [p5 glitch](https://ffd8.github.io/p5.glitch//)
* [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/)
* [p5 ascii](https://p5.textmode.art/)
